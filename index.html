      <h2>March 19, 1931</h2>
      <p>Nevada legalizes various forms of gambling and becomes the only state with legalized gambling. &nbsp;However, betting on sports remained unregulated by the state and, as a result, sports betting largely remained an illegal, undeground activity.</p>

      <h2>April, 1949</h2>
      <p>Nevada sets regulatory framework for legalized sports betting and opens the first government-sanctioned sportsbook. &nbsp;In addition, bookmakers across the state now had the permission and legal authority to accept bets on all professional sports as well as horse racing.</p>

  <div class="container left">

      <h2>March, 1951</h2>
      <p>The Federal Government imposes a 10% excise tax on all Nevada sportsbooks. &nbsp;This ultimately led to the early demise of the legal sportsbook industry as the newly imposed tax made it impossible for them to compete with underground sports betting operations, most of which were run by organized crime.</p>
