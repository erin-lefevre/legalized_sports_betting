      <h2>March 19, 1931</h2>
      <p>Nevada legalizes various forms of gambling and becomes the only state with legalized gambling. &nbsp;However, betting on sports remained unregulated by the state and, as a result, sports betting remained an illegal, undeground activity run mostly by illegal bookies and semi-legal "turf clubs".</p>

      <h2>1949</h2>
      <p>Nevada sets regulatory framework for legalized sports betting and opens the first government-sanctioned sportsbook. &nbsp;In addition, bookmakers across the state now had the permission and legal authority to accept bets on all professional sports as well as horse racing.</p>

      <h2>1951</h2>
      <p>The Federal Government imposes a 10% excise tax on all Nevada sportsbooks. &nbsp;This ultimately drove the majority of sportsbooks underground and away from legitimate, regulated channels as legal sportsbooks could not compete with black market sports betting operations, many of which were run by the mob.</p>
