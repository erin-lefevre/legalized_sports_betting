	<header class ="header"><h3>The Adoption of Legalized Sports Betting across the United States.</h3><p>For the first time in it's 110-year history, the U.S. Forest Service is spending more than 50% of its budget to suppress wildfires. This year alone, there have been over 46,000 fires of varying size and severity across the U.S. While many of the fires go unnoticed by the general public, other fires are immense in their size and voracity and burn thousands of acres in a single day destroying anything in their path. Recent analysis shows that over 46 million homes and 70,000 communities are at risk. Since the year 2000, at least 10 states have had their largest fires on record. </p>
